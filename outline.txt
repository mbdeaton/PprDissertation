Notes
  formatting: use a global description of the phenomenon being discussed at the
    beginning of each section
  formatting: calculate/demonstrate order-of-magnitude estimates of quantities at
    beginning of each section

Neutrinos in Mergers of Neutron Stars With Black Holes

Why it matters
  how common nsbh mergers?
  how common nsns? how similar?
  what can nu do? (nunubar heating, nucleosynthesis, energy loss in nuc accretion)
Historical survey of our knowledge of nsbh & nu
Basic GRHydro overview
Global energy and composition changes (leakage) [2 chapters: methods & results]
  big picture of nus in nsbh mergers
  order of mag estimates
  leakage technical description
  physical results from simulation
Properties of nu emission (ray tracing) [2 chapters: f and nunubar]
  big picture of emission and what's possible (nunubar heating, nu osc)
  ray tracing technical description
  f results, fits to f
  nunubar heating results

2.23.15
Some additional sections I thought of this weekend. Four categories:
1) What other physics is needed to understand this topic?
   radiation transport: limits of Bmann eqn, optical depth, dist func
   gr hydro: u^a, 3+1, SpEC algorithm, ref frames, ev eqns, Ein's eqns and solns
   accretion phys: energy and angular mom transport
   EOS: polytropes, 3D tables, how constructed, effects on mergers
   merger param space: how varying different params effects merger, bestiary
2) What other stuff is needed to motivate this exploration?
   neutrinos: weak interact with matter, how they become relevant at high rho,T
   SGRBs: observed props of light, inferred props of jets/engines, energetics
   nucleosynth: where does r-process come from, types of nucleosynth
   gwaves (?): nature of gw, confirm detection in EM, EMs expected from SGRB
   nu-oscillation: mass/flavor eigenstates, matter resonances, nu observations
3) What has already been done?
4) What else remains to be done?
   M1, full transport, MHD, force-free

(Also, it would be great to write the whole thing in digestible chapters. Many
many chapters.)
