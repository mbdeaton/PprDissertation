Dissertation Outline & Notes

Broad Guidelines:
Use a global description of the phenomenon being discussed and demonstrate
  order-of-magnitude estimates at the beginning of each section.
Lean toward short and digestible sections. Many small sections are more readable
  than a few large ones.
To minimize busywork, always prefer Leakage Paper's conventions and structure.
  (But you may still need to modify that paper, for example to refer to earlier
  equations or expand a section, like ejecta.)
If there's time, include helper sections: 1) derive the fluid equations in 
  minkowski space, to compare the GRHD eqns to, 2) derive all the radiation
  transport equations and quantities for the examples of a hot radiating star
  and a homogeneous emitting medium, 3) discuss accretion and radiation in the
  context of Cyg X-1 to compare to (\sigma_T=6.7e-29 m^2, L_edd=?).

Technical Guidelines:
Attributions: much of this work and writing has been given to you freely by
  others, in particular Matt, Francois, and Andy. Acknowledge them generally in
  the Acknowledgements, but also indicate their work with a sentence before each
  section that uses it. (If you're worried about this *thinning* out your
  dissertation---I am---then prepare a list of all the research you've done over
  the last five years, and the things that you've given to other folks.)
Outflows: don't include discussion of Foucart et al 2013's outflows section,
  because it turns out dynamical outflows don't have much to do with this
  inquiry.
Prefer to use "I", unless it makes more sense to use "we", as throughout the
  leakage chapter.
Prefer to use "Sec. 1" and "Fig. 2" than spelling them out.
Denote a particular tensor components by replacing the index by the standard
  symbol for that component: u^t not u^0.
