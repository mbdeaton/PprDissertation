A massive star that has exhausted its nuclear fuel, ends its radiative life
in a massive supernova, leaving behind either a hot, dense neutron star supported
against gravitational collapse by neutron degeneracy pressure, or a black hole.

Mergers of neutron stars and black holes can yield short-lived nuclear accretion
disks, which emit copious neutrinos. These neutrinos cool the disk and change
its composition over a timescale of milliseconds. We developed a model of the
major effects of this radiation in~\cite{deat2013-leakage}.
