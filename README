Matched WSU formatting up through abstract. (Need to ask WSU Grad School whether
the formatting needs to be explicitly followed. It sure is ugly.)

Figure out how to format TOC/LOT/LOF:

    a list of possible edits to these objects

    how to add "Page" above page numbers in TOC

2.13.15
No worries about formatting of chapter headings and TOC/LOT/LOF, these are flexible
as long as I'm consisitent. So make all of these regular text size, and not bold,
and all caps (Acknowledgements, Abstract, TOC, LOT, LOF). And make everything else
standard latex book format.
