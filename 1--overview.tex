\section{Why this Study?}

However, neutrinos are freely produced in the neutron-rich matter. The
interactions that dominate neutrino opacity are scattering and absorption onto
nucleons and nuclei \citep[Sec.\ 11.7]{shap1983-bh_wd_ns}, all of which processes
scale like $\sigma_0(\varepsilon/m_e c^2)^2$. Here $\sigma_0$ is the weak
scattering cross section,
\begin{align}
  \sigma_0
  &\equiv \frac{4}{\pi}\left(\frac{\hbar}{m_e c}\right)^{-4}
  \left(\frac{G_F}{m_e c^2}\right)^2 \\
  &\sim   1.76 \times 10^{-44} \,\, {\rm cm}^2.
\end{align}
(See, for example, \citealt{tubb1975-neutrino_opacities}.)
