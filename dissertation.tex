  During his first year as a professor (coinciding with his first
  year as a dad), my advisor, Matt Duez, coded up the leakage approximation
  at the center of Chap.~\ref{chap:leakage} of this thesis. I am grateful
  for this and for his mentorship in research and teaching. His reasoning is
  always clear and enlivening.
  In addition, Matt and Francois Foucart wrote the core of the general
  relativistic hydrodynamics code that I used. Without the robust simulation
  tool they developed, I could not have done this work.
  Andy Bohn wrote the ray-tracing code our collaboration uses to find event
  horizons. His clear coding style and generous correspondence made it easy
  for me to co-opt large parts of his work for my own ray-tracing code.

  Matt, Francois, and Evan O'Connor passed
  on their knowledge of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and radiation transport
  through discussions, emails, video conferences, and during my visit to the
  University of Toronto.
  Many other colleagues gave me a bit of their time and knowledge: particularly
  Jeff Kaplan, Mark Scheel, B\'ela Szil\'agyi, Curran Muhlberger,
  Daniel Hemberger, and Saul Teukolsky.

  Together Matt and I co-wrote \citealt{deat2013-leakage}
  (Chap.~\ref{chap:leakage} of this thesis).
  Francois, Evan, and Christian Ott
  thoroughly read and commented on each draft,
  and my writing grew in stature and wisdom and in favor with God and man.

  My colleague and friend Fatemeh Hossein-Nouri helped me in countless debugging
  sessions, shared her relativistic intuition, and introduced me to Hafiz.
  My friends Dan Helms, Ryan Niemeyer, Dusty Vaughn, Phillip Jacobs, Riley
  Rex, Josef Felver, and Joseph Halbert were happy and strong.
  My mom and dad, Mike and JoEtta, were early and late guides.
  One of my favorite undergraduate professors, Mike Sadler, crossed paths with me
  at every April APS Meeting. Once, after one of my talks,
  he told me directly and gently, ``I didn't understand how your findings could
  be tested,'' and I've taken that to heart.

  Finally, my wife and companion, Darci, has lit up the last half of my graduate
  studies with her own probing intellect and love. This work bears the imprint
  of some of her questions.

Mergers of a neutron star and a black hole are interesting because of the dual
complexity of the black hole's strong gravity and the neutron star's
nuclear-density fluid.
Mergers can yield short-lived nuclear accretion disks, emitting copious neutrinos.
This radiation
may change the thermodynamic state of the disk itself,
may drive an ultrarelativistic jet of electrons and positrons,
may oscillate in its flavor content,
may irradiate surrounding matter, playing a role in nucleosynthesis,
and may be detected directly.

In this thesis I present a model of such a merger, its remnant accretion disk,
and its neutrino emission.
In particular, we evolve a neutron star--black hole merger through $\sym100$~ms,
solving the full general relativistic hydrodynamics equations,
from inspiral through merger and accretion epochs.
We treat the neutrinos approximately, using a leakage framework,
which accounts for local energy losses and composition drift in the fluid due
to escaping neutrinos.
We use geodesic ray tracing on a late time slice of the model to calculate the full
spatial-, angular-, and energy-dependence of the neutrino distribution function
around the accretion disk.
This distribution then serves in a computation of the energy available to
form a jet via neutrino-antineutrino annihilation in the disk funnel.
In this scenario, we find that enough energy is deposited
to drive a jet of short-gamma-ray-burst-energy by neutrino processes alone.
