  My advisor, Matt Duez, wrote the core of the general relativistic hydrodynamics
  code that I used to evolve the models in this work. I am grateful for his
  mentorship in research and teaching. His reasoning is always clear and
  enlivening. My colleague Francois Foucart is the co-author of that code.
  Without the robust simulation tool they developed, I could not have done this
  work. In addition, Francois and another colleague, Evan O'Connor, passed on
  their knowledge of hydrodynamics, thermodynamics, and radiation transport
  through emails, video conferences, and during my visit to the University of
  Toronto. My colleague, Andy Bohn, wrote the ray-tracing code our collaboration
  uses to find event horizons in arbitary vacuum spacetimes. His clear coding
  style and generous correspondence made it easy for me to co-opt large parts of
  his work for own my ray-tracing code. Many other colleagues gave me a bit of
  their time and knowledge: particularly Jeff Kaplan, Mark Scheel, B\'ela
  Szil\'agyi, Curran Muhlberger, and Daniel Hemberger.
  Christian Ott thoroughly read and commented on each draft of
  \citealt{deat2013-leakage} (Chap.~\ref{chap:leakage} of this thesis). It is
  a good thing to listen to him and ask him questions: my writing grew in stature
  and wisdom, and in favor with God and man.

  My colleague and friend Fatemeh Hossein-Nouri helped in countless debugging
  sessions, shared her relativistic intuition, and introduced me to Hafiz.
  My friends Dan Helms, Ryan Niemeyer, Dusty Vaughn, Phillip Jacobs, and Riley
  Rex were my friends.
  My mom and dad, Mike and JoEtta, were early and late guides.
  One of my favorite undergraduate professors, Mike Sadler, stumbled into me
  not-quite-by-chance at every April APS Meeting. Once, after one of my talks,
  he told me directly and gently, ``I didn't understand how your findings could
  be tested.'' I've taken that to heart, Dr.\ Sadler.

  Finally, my wife and companion, Darci, has lit up the last half of my graduate
  studies with her own probing intellect and love. This work bears the imprint
  of some of her questions.

Mergers of a neutron star and a black hole are interesting because of the dual
complexity of strong gravity and nuclear-density fluid. In this dissertation,
I present a model of such an event useful in teaching us about the role of
neutrinos in these events.
